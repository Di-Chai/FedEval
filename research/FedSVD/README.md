## FedSVD

This is the open-sourced code for paper "Practical Loss Federated Singular Vector Decomposition over Billion-Scale Data".

The source code for implementing FedSVD is located at [FedSVD.py](../../FedEval/strategy/FedSVD.py).

To reproduce the results in the paper, please follow the following steps.

#### 1) Prepare the environment

Since we implement and benchmark the FedSVD in [FedEval](https://github.com/Di-Chai/FedEval), please refer to [Environment](https://di-chai.github.io/FedEval/Environment.html) to get the environment ready.

#### 2) Reproduce the results

We have provided a script for reproducing all the efficiency and lossless results for SVD and its applications.

The detailed commends are listed bellow.

```bash

```

For the attacking experiments and other baseline experiments, please refer the following instructions.

```bash

```
