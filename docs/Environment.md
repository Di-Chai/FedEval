## Environment

In this section, we will help you building the environment. 

### Software Dependencies

#### System Requirements

Currently, this system only support **Linux** platforms.

Recommended memory sizes for different dataset and models are shown in the following table. Increasing the swap space is a good solution if your compute does not have enough memory.

| Dataset | ML Model |  Required RAM size   |
| :-----: | :------: | :------------------: |
|  MNIST  |   MLP    | 32 GB / 100 Clients  |
|  MNIST  |  LeNet   | 80 GB / 100 Clients  |
| FEMNIST |  LeNet   | 60 GB / 100 Clients  |
| CelebA  |  LeNet   | 128 GB / 100 Clients |
| Sent140 |  LSTM    | 128 GB / 100 Clients |

#### Docker & Docker Compose (without sudo)

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an indispensable component to virtualize the software and network environment in order to isolate each instance. Follow these [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install Docker on your machine. Follow the guideline on [Link](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user) to manage docker as non-root user. Docker has been successfully installed if you got a similar output like this:

```shell
$ docker --version
Docker version 20.10.2, build 2291f61
```

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool aimed at easing multi-container operations. Install it under the [guidance](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and check it with:

```shell
$ docker-compose version
docker-compose version 1.27.4, build 40524192
docker-py version: 4.3.1
CPython version: 3.7.4
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.1.1c  28 May 2019
```

#### Python

Though most of the programs can be boosted inside containers, it is still recommended to have a Python interpreter installed on your machine for the convenience and immediacy of type checking, auto complete, and so on during code profiling or some advanced, self-defined operations.

For the sake of compatibility with main components of the system, the version of the interpreter should be in the range of 3.5â€“3.8 currently. You can find how to install them [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

#### Git (Optional)

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system. We use it and host this project on [Github](https://github.com/Di-Chai/FedEval). Feel free to skip this because you also can download the project as a zip file from the web page.

Clone the project from Github in this way if have installed git.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Di-Chai/FedEval.git -b dev-0.1
```

### Build the Docker Image

The image we build will be used by each instance (both server and clients).

First, clone the project from GitHub:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Di-Chai/FedEval.git
```

Enter the project directory and build the image.

```shell
cd docker
sudo docker build . -t fedeval:v1
```

Check image status. This command will list all docker images on your machine.

```shell
sudo docker image ls
```

And you'll got something like these if nothing goes wrong. It's okay if the image ID is different.

```
REPOSITORY     TAG     IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
fedeval        v1      2386be014ab5   3 months ago    4.39GB
```

### Download the dataset

The dataset is available at : [resources](https://www.jianguoyun.com/p/DZ8I2q8QhdfRChiDntUEIAA)

Download the `data.tar.gz`, and put it at the project directory. Using the following commend to unpack the data:

```bash
mv data.tar.gz FedEval
cd FedEval
tar -zxvf data.tar.gz
```
