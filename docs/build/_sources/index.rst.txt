The ACTPR Benchmarking System
========================================

ACTPR Model
----------------

The ACTPR model is the core of our benchmarking system. It defines five evaluation metrics for the FL systems: Accuracy, Communication, Time consumption, Privacy and Robustness.

   The framework of the benchmarking system

We publish an easy-to-use and lightweight benchmarking system for federated learning (FL). The above figure shows the framework of the system, and it contains the following three steps:

- **Step 1:** Distribute the data to all clients, where different strategies can be applied to generate IID or non-IID data.
- **Step 2:** Provide the training scripts and distribute the codes to all the clients.
- **Step 3:** Training the model. The ACTPR evaluation model will run automatically in this step. 

We used the docker container technology to simulate the server and clients. The isolation between different containers guarantees that our simulation can reflect the real-world application. **All the benchmark system is open-sourced, and five benchmark FL datasets are included in the system.** Thus researches can implement their new idea and evaluate with ACTPR model very quickly.

   The Project Overview

The above figure shows the overview of our project. We provide one model scripts and three config files (i.e., model config, runtime config, and data config) to the system.
