## Dataset

Three datasets are used in the experiments: MNIST \citep{lecun1998gradient}, CIFAR-10 \citep{krizhevsky2009learning}, FEMNIST \citep{caldas2018leaf}, CelebA \citep{liu2015deep, caldas2018leaf}. We perform the classification task on all datasets. FEMNIST is an extended MNIST dataset based on handwritten digits and characters. CelebA builds on the Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes Dataset, and we use the \textit{smiling} label as the classification target. For the non-IID evaluation, we use different strategies. In MNIST and CIFAR-10, we simulate non-IID by restricting the number of clients' local image classes. Experiments of each client has $1,2$ and $3$ classes are reported. In FEMNIST and CelebA, we have the identity of who generates the data. Thus we partition the data naturally based on the identity, and perform a random shuffle for IID setting.
