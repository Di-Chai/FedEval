## Dataset

Three datasets are used in the experiments: [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), [FEMNIST](https://github.com/TalwalkarLab/leaf#datasets), [CelebA](https://github.com/TalwalkarLab/leaf#datasets). We perform the classification task on all datasets. FEMNIST is an extended MNIST dataset based on handwritten digits and characters. CelebA builds on the Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes Dataset, and we use the *smiling* label as the classification target. For the non-IID evaluation, we use different strategies. In MNIST and CIFAR-10, we simulate non-IID by restricting the number of clients' local image classes. Experiments of each client has $1,2$ and $3$ classes are reported. In FEMNIST and CelebA, we have the identity of who generates the data. Thus we partition the data naturally based on the identity, and perform a random shuffle for IID setting.
